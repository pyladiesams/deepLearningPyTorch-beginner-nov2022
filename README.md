# Deep learning with PyTorch: a beginning guide towards DL applications
### Level: Beginner

### Presentation: [Deep Learning with PyTorch](workshop/Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.pdf)

## Workshop description
During the workshop you will learn the basis of PyTorch and how to use it for designing a deep learning model with an outlook on more advanced applications.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7 or higher
* Jupyter notebook or Jupyter lab

## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Install the required libraries with pip: ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` NB: PyTorch installation can take some time and depends on the operating system and GPU drivers if any. More information on the PyTorch installation process could be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* Start Jupyter notebook(lab) and navigate to the workshop folder
